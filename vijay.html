  Thanthai Periyar, born Erode Venkatappa Ramasamy, was an Indian social activist and politician who played a pivotal role in the Self-Respect Movement and the establishment of the Dravidar Kazhagam. He is often referred to as the 'Father of the Dravidian movement' and is known for his advocacy of rationalism, self-respect, women's rights, and the eradication of caste. Periyar's influence extended beyond politics, as he promoted social justice and equality for the non-Brahmin Dravidian people of South India. His legacy continues to inspire social justice movements in India.
